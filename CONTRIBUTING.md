# Contributing to the HarmonisedMatChemWG Field Guides

First off, thank you for being here! This repository exists to provide high-quality, community-vetted best practices. To maintain the integrity and focus of these field guides, we recomend a specific contribution workflow centered on consensus and precision.

## Our Philosophy: Small, Impactful Changes

We believe the best guides are built through incremental improvements rather than sweeping changes.

* **Focus over Volume:** We prefer Pull Requests (PRs) that fix a single paragraph, update or add a specific link, or clarify a single concept.
* **Discussion before Action:** Documentation is only as good as the consensus behind it. It is critically important that issue-centric discussions occur before changes are made, using the issue functionality built into GitHub.
* **Precision:** Major document rewrites or changes affecting multiple sections are discouraged. Please feel free to submit multiple issues.

Contribution is achieved through the following three steps:

### 1. The Mandatory First Step: Open an Issue

Before you begin writing or opening a Pull Request (PR), you **must** create a GitHub Issue to propose the change.

* **The Discussion Period:** Once an issue is raised, the community needs time to debate the proposal. This ensures the "Best Practice" being added is truly vetted and consensus-based.
* **Wait for Alignment:** Please do not submit a PR until a maintainer or a clear community consensus has signaled that the proposal is ready to be implemented.
* **Linking:** Your eventual PR must reference this issue number.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pull Requests submitted without a prior, debated issue will be closed to ensure the community discussion happens first.

### 2. Submission Guidelines

When you are ready to submit your changes, please adhere to the following constraints:

#### Scope of Changes

* **Single-Section Focus:** Address only one highly focused part of a document per PR.
* **No "Bulk" Edits:** If you see three different things that need fixing, open three separate issues and three separate PRs. This keeps the history clean and the reviews fast. The only acceptable bulk edits are markdown formatting/syntax issues that don't impact underlying technical content.

#### Formatting & Style

* **Markdown Standard:** Use [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/). Ensure your nesting and headers follow the existing hierarchy of the document.
* **Style Consistency:** Match the existing tone of the guide, which aims to be objective, authoritative, yet accessible.
* **Linking the Issue:** In your PR description, use the keyword `Closes #123` (replacing 123 with your issue number).

### 3. The Review Process

1. **Peer Review:** Other contributors may suggest wording tweaks to ensure the change fits the flow of the document.
2. **Maintainer Approval:** A maintainer will perform a final check for formatting and alignment with the original issue discussion.
3. **Merge:** Once merged, your contribution will be live in the best practice guides!

## New Field Guide Proposals

If you want to suggest an entirely new best practice guide, or some other major contribution, this is best achieved by organizing a Birds of a Feather (BoF) Session within an RDA Plenary Meeting.
